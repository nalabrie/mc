# Description:  Minecraft server manager script.
#               On a schedule, it will (as needed):
#                   - stop the server
#                   - backup the server
#                   - update the server
#                   - restart the server
#
#       Usage:  ./manager.py <server directory> \
#                            <local backup directory> \
#                            <remote backup directory> \
#                            <run server script> \
#                            <ram in GB> \
